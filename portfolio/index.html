			<h2><em> About me </em> </h2>
			<p> My name is Hawkin Mogen. I am a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay with a bachelor's degree in education.
				I am currently in the job hunt, working to find the career that is right for me. In the midst of that, I am working at Buffalo Wild Wings as a server. 
				Certainly not a career, but I enjoy it for the time being. I am a versatile person who is willing to step into many different fields. I possess the work ethic to succeed in various fields whether it be STEM related or the humanities.
				 </p>
			<p> I currently reside in Sheboygan, Wisconsin but have lived all across the country during my childhood as my dad was in the Coast Guard. 
				I spend most weekends visiting my girlfriend in Milwaukee and have a slew of other activities and hobbies which I take part in. One of which being my new task of making this website and learning the basics of web development.

			<h2><em> Past Experiences </em></h2>
			<p> As an education major, I spent a lot of time participating in field placements in various Green Bay Area Public Schools. These field placements put you in a position to participate in the daily functions of the classroom as much as you wanted.
				I took this as an opportunity to make an impact as well as prepare myself as best I could for a potential future career. Throughout all of my field placements I gave exemplary effort and worked to step out of my comfort zone.
				I was recognized for my efforts during my Fall 2016 field placement when I was awarded the "Phuture Phoenix: Above and Beyond Service Award" </p>
			<p> As I began to consider career options during my senior year of college, I decided I wanted to pursue a career as an Air Force Officer. I began the year long application process in the winter of 2018 and it concluded December of 2019.
				After an arduous process, I was accepted into the Air Force's, Officer's Training School. Although I find myself ultimately unable to accept this offer for personal reasons, I do consider it one of my greatest accomplishments. 
				The application involved two interviews with Lieutenant Colonels, letters of recommendation, and lots of paper work. Testing was also involved. I excelled in both the Air Force Officer's Qualifying Test as well as the Test of Basic Aviation Skills.
				I also took part in private flying lessons at Austin Straubel Airport in Green Bay in an effort to boost my scores and strengthen my overall application. </p>

			<h2><em> Hobbies </em></h2>
			<p> One important hobby of mine is playing the guitar. I have been playing consistently for about three years now and am always trying to improve. 
				I enjoy playing some of my favorite artists such as The Smiths and Radiohead. I also am always trying to create pieces of my own. </p>
			<p> Another hobby of mine is playing sports, basketball specifically. I love to play whenever I can, my ability to consistently play was one of my favorite thigns about my college schedule. Lately I have been able to much less frequently but hope to change that as soon as possible.
